# Purple Calculator

I wanted to challenge my React skills learned from the internet and to put my problem solving skills to the test.
So, I decided what better way to do that than to build my own calculator? Eventually, the project evolved into not just being any old boring calculator because this one is purple themed. I hope you enjoy using it as much as I enjoyed coding it.
